                    <p>Salman Rushdie’s 1988 magical realist novel caused international controversy. Its depiction of Islamic themes led to death threats against the author and bans in many Muslim countries, yet the book went on to become a powerful symbol of artistic freedom.</p>

            <h3>⏳ The Battle Continues</h3>
            <p>Today, the fight for freedom of expression goes on. New books are banned every year, while old ones resurface. Governments still fear ideas that challenge their power, or simply tell the truth.</p>
            <p>Yet history shows us that banned books often are the most important ones—their censorship shows the power to change minds. These books remind us that silence is never neutral, and we must always speak out.</p>
