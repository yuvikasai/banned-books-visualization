            <h2>📖 The Power of the Written Word</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, books have been banned, burned, and censored by governments fearful of ideas. From ancient Rome to modern nations, the act of suppressing literature reveals what those in power fear most: free thought, uncomfortable truths, and voices of dissent.</p>
            <p>This visualization explores <strong>234 books</strong> that challenged authority so profoundly they were banned across <strong>64 countries</strong>. Each ban tells a story of fear, control, and the enduring power of words to spark change.</p>

                    <h4>The Satanic Verses</h4>
                    <p class="story-stat">Banned in 14 countries</p>
                    <p>Salman Rushdie's magical realist novel sparked international controversy in 1988. The book's portrayal of Islamic themes led to death threats, a fatwa calling for Rushdie's assassination, and bans across the Muslim world. Rushdie lived in hiding for years, yet the book became a symbol of artistic freedom.</p>

                    <p>George Orwell's political allegory was banned by both communist and fascist regimes who recognized themselves in its critique of totalitarianism. The story of farm animals overthrowing their human master became too dangerous a metaphor for revolutions that had gone wrong.</p>

                    <h4>Ulysses</h4>

                    <p>James Joyce's modernist epic faced bans and seizures for its candid portrayal of sexuality and its experimental style. The 1933 U.S. court decision clearing Ulysses became a landmark victory for literary freedom and helped reshape censorship standards.</p>

            <h3>💭 The Battle Continues</h3>
            <p>Today, the fight for freedom of expression rages on. New books are banned every year, while old ones resurface on censorship lists. Governments still fear ideas that challenge their power, question their legitimacy, or simply tell uncomfortable truths.</p>
            <p>Yet history shows us that banned books often become the most important ones—their censorship a badge of honor signaling their power to change minds and challenge the status quo. These books remind us that silence is never neutral, and the written word remains humanity's most potent weapon against tyranny.</p>
